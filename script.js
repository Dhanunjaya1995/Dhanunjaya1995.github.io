    1) Mechanical engineering is a broad and practical field. It uses principles of physics and math to design and build machines and systems. This field offers many opportunities, from working on robots and vehicles to designing energy systems and more.
    2) During my bachelor's in mechanical engineering, I worked on two important projects that helped me learn practical skills. One project was a tea serving robot, where I designed and built a machine that could serve tea automatically. This project taught me about robotics, automation, and how to combine mechanical parts with control systems.
    3) Another key project was building a racing car for the ISSE India competition. In this project, I helped design a lightweight and fast car that could compete in races. Working on the racing car helped me understand aerodynamics, material choices, and performance optimization. Both projects gave me hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of mechanical engineering.

    1) During my tenure at Alten for the Dematic client, I developed sophisticated web applications that interfaced with the main sorter control system to create a SCADA-like plant visualization platform. This real-time monitoring solution enabled remote device control, significantly reducing manual intervention and enhancing operational efficiency while laying the groundwork for further automation and data-driven decision-making.
    2) I also led the development of Grafana dashboards driven by complex SQL queries, which were crucial for analyzing post-commissioning performance. These dashboards provided clear, actionable insights that helped quickly identify trends and inefficiencies, ensuring that any issues were addressed promptly and that operational adjustments were data-informed.
    3) In addition, I automated repetitive tasks using Python, including an OCR-based screen capture system for UI interactions, which reduced manual errors and sped up data processing. I also designed efficient data pipelines to collect and process sorter messages, further improving operational transparency and proactive system monitoring.

    1) At Dematic (Client: GXO & Kering), I created a notification system that monitored pipeline alerts in real time using Data Factory. I also built a bot with Python that connected to Oracle databases to answer order inquiries automatically. This work helped reduce manual work and ensured that important alerts were handled quickly.
    2) In my role as an Associate Data Analytics Engineer, I improved daily operations by writing complex Oracle SQL queries, stored procedures, and functions. These solutions made it easier to get and process data, which helped our team work faster and more reliably. This allowed us to solve issues quickly and keep our data accurate.
    3) I also developed performance reporting systems using Excel and PowerBI. These reports turned raw data into clear, easy-to-understand information that helped the team make better decisions. By providing useful insights, I supported efforts to improve system efficiency and drive a data-focused work culture.
